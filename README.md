# Computer Vision Intro

This project was the challenge for Computer Vision Introduction class, concluded on the second year of my course.
Basically we used the code of one of the thousands of versions fo the original Atari game called Breakout and introduced a several tools from OpenCV to control the gamepad.

All of the tests were made in Pycharm IDE.

We tried three different controls using three diferent tools.
